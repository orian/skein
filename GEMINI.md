# RULES

1. before any non trivial change, create a plan and write it down to docs/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<title>.md
2. always create tests for new features
3. for API, create a schema, at least a struct to parse into, the same for the JSON responses
4. do not add trivial and obvious comments to code
5. make the minimal changes that implement what is asked for
